# WebKit Nightly Updater

Improved updater based on script by daaku from [Mac OS X Hints](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20080409043122690)
* Can install without having `WebKit.app` already present
* Can install from existing DMG when something fails between download completion and installation

## Usage

```shell
./webkit-updater.sh
```

## Notes

Will copy previous WebKit bundles to the trash (named based on the date).

## Legal

Considered public domain as it is based on a public-facing comment.
